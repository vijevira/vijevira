# Apsona for Salesforce

## üìå Overview
Apsona for Salesforce is a productivity and automation platform built on top of Salesforce, designed to extend CRM capabilities with reporting, document automation, and workflow tools.  
It allows Salesforce users to generate complex reports, automate document merges, and integrate external services without leaving the Salesforce environment.  

One critical part of Apsona‚Äôs ecosystem is the **payment and subscription system**, which ensures that features and services are available only to licensed customer orgs.  
This system validates entitlements, manages client-specific usage, and integrates with Salesforce orgs for secure feature access.
