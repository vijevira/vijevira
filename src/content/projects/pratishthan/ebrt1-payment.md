## European instant Payment

### Overview
RT1 is a pan-European, instant payment system for euro-denominated transactions that operates 24/7/365, and while Switzerland is not part of the SEPA zone, Swiss banks and financial institutions can participate in RT1 by becoming a SCT Inst Scheme adherent and utilizing the RT1 infrastructure to provide instant euro payments across SEPA.
