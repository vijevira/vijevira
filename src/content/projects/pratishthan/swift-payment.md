## Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication

### Overview
The **SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication)** network is the leading global provider of secure financial messaging services. It connects over 11,000 banks and financial institutions across more than 200 countries, enabling standardized and reliable communication for international payments.

SWIFT itself does not transfer money but provides a secure messaging platform that allows banks to send and receive instructions for transferring funds. Every institution is assigned a **unique SWIFT/BIC code**, which ensures that messages are routed correctly.

**How it works:**
1. A customer initiates an international transfer at their local bank.
2. The bank formats the message using SWIFT ISO 15022/ISO 20022 standards.
3. The message is securely transmitted through the SWIFT network.
4. The destination bank receives the instruction and credits the beneficiaryâ€™s account.
5. Settlement is managed by correspondent or intermediary banks when required.

**Key features:**
- Global reach and standardization.  
- ISO-compliant structured messages (MT / MX formats).  
- Secure and encrypted network ensuring confidentiality and integrity.  
- Supports payments, securities, treasury, and trade transactions.
