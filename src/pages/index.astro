      <h1>üëã Hello, I'm Vijendra</h1>

      <h3>üìç Who I Am</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a highly versatile and dedicated <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with
        a strong foundation in backend technologies and modern web frameworks. Born
        in <strong>Bihar</strong> and currently living in <strong
          >Bangalore</strong
        >, I hold a <strong
          >Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Engineering</strong
        > from the University Institute of Technology, The University of Burdwan
        (CGPA: <strong>8.38</strong>).
      </p>
      <p>
        My academic path has been consistent and strong, scoring <strong
          >84.2%</strong
        > in 12th grade at Delhi Public School, Varanasi, and a <strong
          >9.8 CGPA</strong
        > in 10th grade from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya.
      </p>

      <h3>üíº My Work Journey</h3>
      <p>
        I bring over <strong>3 years of industry experience</strong> in building
        robust applications and secure backend systems. My career began at <strong
          >Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)</strong
        > (Oct 2021 ‚Äì Aug 2022), where I contributed to frontend development using
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, and Java. I helped build reusable UI components,
        improved layouts, and implemented input validation systems for enterprise-scale
        web applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        I then joined <strong>Pratishthan Software Ventures</strong> (Sep 2022 ‚Äì
        Aug 2024), where I engineered mission-critical payment infrastructure for
        banks and financial institutions. I worked on systems such as <strong
          >SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)</strong
        >, <strong>QCBIP (Qatar Central Bank Instant Payments)</strong>, <strong
          >UAERT (UAE Real-Time Transfers)</strong
        >, and <strong>SWIFT</strong> messaging flows. My responsibilities included
        developing <strong>real-time payment flows</strong>, managing <strong
          >return/reject cycles</strong
        >, and building <strong>SLA tracking mechanisms</strong> to meet strict regulatory
        standards. I also enhanced systems integrated with <strong>NACH</strong>
        and <strong>NPCI</strong>, contributing to the stability and reliability
        of national payment systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Pratishthan, I worked across the full stack‚Äîdeveloping performant
        services, securing API integrations, handling Kafka-based event streams,
        and ensuring compliance with <strong>ISO 20022</strong>. I collaborated
        with banking clients and cross-functional teams to deliver
        production-ready modules in agile environments, further sharpening my
        skills in building scalable, fault-tolerant systems within the fintech
        domain.
      </p>

      <p>
        I currently work as a <strong>Senior Software Engineer at Apsona</strong
        >, where I focus on backend engineering, DevOps integration, and system
        architecture. One of my core contributions has been the development of <strong
          >apsona_nexus_svc</strong
        >, a secure Node.js service that provides REST APIs to interact with <strong
          >HashiCorp Vault</strong
        >. This service supports read, write, patch, and selective key deletion
        for credentials, with token-based authentication, modular controller
        design, robust error handling, and logging. I ensured code quality
        through ESLint integration and comprehensive unit testing using Jest and
        Supertest.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to Vault integration, I led the implementation of the <strong
          >clear cache system for all users</strong
        >, designed the <strong
          >Merge button for Salesforce Lightning List View</strong
        >, and built functionality for <strong
          >PDF storage uploads to client orgs</strong
        >. I also contributed to the <strong
          >segregation of legacy monorepos</strong
        > into well-scoped services like PDF SVC and SFDC SVC, and upgraded services
        from Node.js v8 to v18. I enforced strong linting rules and testing practices
        across the codebase.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another notable contribution was automating <strong
          >Excel merge operations via schedulers</strong
        >. I resolved long-standing issues related to mock duplication in XML
        templates and JQuery. I implemented <strong>JWT token caching</strong> to
        reduce Vault overhead, and added a user-friendly UI tool for <strong
          >periodic cache clearing</strong
        >. My work also touched Salesforce Flows, LWC components, Vault TTL
        logic, and scalable API design. I consistently followed clean Git
        workflows and documented solutions through Google Docs, diagrams, and
        internal knowledge sharing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside my full-time roles, I‚Äôve also taken on freelance positions as
        an <strong>AI Prompt Engineer at Alignerr</strong> and an <strong
          >AI Trainer at Outlier</strong
        >. These opportunities allowed me to explore applied AI/ML, contributing
        to prompt refinement and model training workflows on real-world data.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work is rooted in solving real-world problems‚Äîwhether it's building
        scalable systems, improving developer experience, or enabling secure
        integrations. I thrive in collaborative teams and value continuous
        learning, knowledge sharing, and clean, thoughtful engineering.
